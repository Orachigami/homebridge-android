You can watch the video of the process [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sc3o7uwlLHg) or complete steps manually.

### Configure your device

The Termux app, which is going to be installed in the next step, is deprecated on Play Market, Play Store, etc. That is why enabling app installation from `Unknown Sources` is required.

1. Open `Settings` <picture><img src="/assets/settings-icon.png" alt="Settings icon" width="30px"></picture>

### Install Homebridge

1. Open this page and copy command below:
```bash
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Orachigami/homebridge-android/main/setup.sh | bash
```
2. Open Termux app <picture><img src="/assets/termux-icon.png" alt="Termux icon" width="30px"></picture>
3. Wait until it launches
4. Tap & Hold your finger on any place until you see a context menu with `COPY PASTE MORE...` buttons
5. Tap `PASTE`
6. Tap `Enter` button which should like something like :leftwards_arrow_with_hook: or ðŸ”Ž

Installation process takes approximately 5 minutes.

If everything was installed successfully you will receive:

> == Installation successful ==<br>Execute hb command to start

### After installation

To test that Homebridge just works execute any of these commands:

| Regular start | Start with Accessory Control |
| --- | --- |
| <picture><img src="data://" width="200px" height="1px"></picture><br><pre lang="bash">hb</pre> | <picture><img src="data://" width="200px" height="1px"></picture><br><pre lang="bash">hb -I</pre> |

Wait for the message:

> [Homebridge UI] Homebridge Config UI X ... is listening on :: port 8581

Which means that you can open your browser, type in the address bar http\://\<your device ip>:8581 and complete setup.

### Complete: Login to the Homebridge UI

The [Homebridge UI](https://github.com/oznu/homebridge-config-ui-x) web interface will allow you to install, remove and update plugins, and modify the Homebridge config.json and manage other aspects of your Homebridge service.

Login to the web interface by going to http\://\<ip address of your device>:8581.

To find the IP address of your server you can run:

```bash
ifconfig | awk '/netmask/{print $2}'
```

Ignore 127.0.0.1 if you don't know what it is.
